# SwiftUI_Learning_Part4
## 1⃣️ Introduction :
   When I took the course in Parts 1-3, there was a difference between the official SwiftUI version and the swiftUI version used in the course. If I want to fix the code error caused by the version problem, I can only solve it by myself. As a newbie in programming, this is a bit difficult for me. But by chance, I found the part 4  of the course on the acfun website. Part 4 is dedicated to introducing the latest SwiftUI version, Xcode and Mac os. This is very useful for me at this time. I recorded some notes in the README.md, and good luck for myself

    Finished the 7th  & 8th lesson with one  problem,   I learned how to use the transition modifier, which will help us connect or bind animations and views. This is  my understanding.then , Then, when I got to lesson 8, I had a problem , I didn't know what Namepace meant,  but I knew that the matchedgeometryeffect  looked  like Smooth transition in PPT . If you know what's  the  "Namepace" means? or how does it work ? please tell me and teach  me .Thanks very much .

    Finished the 9th  & 10th lesson without   problem, In this lesson about how to show Views, we used a new modifier: asymmetry, which allows us to distinguish between inserted and removed animations, and I created a data file named Course, and everything is fine.

**Date : 2021 - 01 - 14 :**    
    Finished the 11th without problem, In this lesson, we use a state variable to determine which card is selected, and we use a modifier "isdisable" to determine whether a card is displayed
