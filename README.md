# SwiftUI_Learning_Part4
## 1⃣️ Introduction :
   When I took the course in Parts 1-3, there was a difference between the official SwiftUI version and the swiftUI version used in the course. If I want to fix the code error caused by the version problem, I can only solve it by myself. As a newbie in programming, this is a bit difficult for me. But by chance, I found the part 4  of the course on the acfun website. Part 4 is dedicated to introducing the latest SwiftUI version, Xcode and Mac os. This is very useful for me at this time. I recorded some notes in the README.md, and good luck for myself

    Finished the 7th  & 8th lesson with one  problem,   I learned how to use the transition modifier, which will help us connect or bind animations and views.
